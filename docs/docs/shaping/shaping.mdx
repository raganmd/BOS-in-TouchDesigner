# Workshop Day 1

On our first day we'll focus on the basics. We'll start with a quick round of introductions and then dive into working with TouchDesigner. We'll start by looking at the user interface, and learning about the different operator families. We'll then get started right away by setting up a render network, and working with post processing effects. There are lots of ways we can manipulate video in TouchDesigner, and getting a firm handle on what image manipulation looks like will set us up for working with camera effects in the late afternoon. We'll warp the day by looking at creating custom parameters and outputting our content to another window or another screen. 

During the workshop we'll create everything together so you have the hands on experience of building networks yourself. While that's great for working in the moment, sometimes you want (or need) an extra reference. The workshop repo also contains a file that's the end of day file - this contains all of the exercises we've gone over together in the workshop. This can be helpful as a reference, but also if you get stuck and need to compare you work to an example.

## Prep

On Day 2 we'll be using [TouchOSC]. Make sure you download and install this application before tomorrow - we'll only be working locally, so you only need to install it on your laptop. While there is a paid version of this app, we will only be using the features in the free version for the workshop.
